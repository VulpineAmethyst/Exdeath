        <h2>Exdeath</h2>
        <p>Exdeath is a patch compactor, a tool that applies multiple patches to a single target file. You will need the US version of the Gameboy Advance release, which you can find through your favourite search engine. </p>
        <p>The program should have the following file layout:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><tt>Exdeath.exe</tt> — the program itself.</li>
            <li><tt>libgcc_s_seh-1.dll</tt> — base library for programs built with GCC for Windows.</li>
            <li><tt>libstdc++-6.dll</tt> — base library for C++ programs.</li>
            <li><tt>libwinpthread-1.dll</tt> — library for threaded execution.</li>
            <li><tt>modes/</tt> — This directory contains patches which alter Final Fantasy V Advance gameplay significantly.</li>
            <li><tt>ned/</tt> — This directory contains patches which replace Neo Exdeath graphics.</li>
            <li><tt>platforms/qwindows.dll</tt> — Qt 6 platform library for Windows.</li>
            <li><tt>Qt6Core.dll</tt> — Qt 6 core library.</li>
            <li><tt>Qt6Gui.dll</tt> — Qt 6 GUI library.</li>
            <li><tt>Qt6Widgets.dll</tt> — Qt 6 widgets library.</li>
            <li><tt>readme.html</tt> — This document, which you are reading now.</li>
            <li><tt>readme.balance.html</tt> — Documentation for Ian's Rebalance patch.</li>
            <li><tt>readme.waddle.html</tt> — Documentation for The Great Waddler's Balance patch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This version provides the following features:</p>
        <h3>Main</h3>
        <p>The real meat of the program: the patches. As of 0.10.0, only the base game is built in to Exdeath. You can add more modes by placing them in the <tt>modes/</tt> directory. No support is provided for mode patches which did not come with Exdeath, however.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Base</b>:<ul>
                <li>None &mdash; The base game.</li>
                <li><a href="http://jeffludwig.com/ff5a/download.php">Custom Classes</a> &mdash; A different remixed version by ludmeister.</li>
                <li><a href="readme.balance.html">Ian's Rebalance</a> &mdash; A remixed version that has a more subtle touch than the other three.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rvf9l3pwbkelu42/ffvamod-doc.txt?dl=0">Balance</a> &mdash; A remixed version which adds the Hero Job and changes things up.</li>
                <li><a href="readme.waddle.html">Waddler Rebalance</a> &mdash; Yet another remixed version which aims to pump up some underwhelming Jobs without altering overall balance too much.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><b>Unlocked Jobs</b>: Unlocks all jobs directly out of the gate. Half of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ldlmpoepxk5nxgl/fiesta.ups?dl=0">wormsofcan's Fiesta patch</a>.</li>
            <li><b>FFT-style Portraits</b>: As the name implies, this option replaces the portraits with edited Final Fantasy Tactics portraits. (missing attribution, sorry.)</li>
            <li><b>Sound Restoration</b>: The <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/563/">Sound Restoration</a> hack modifies the soundfont and corrects some slow-down issues. It can cause artifacting, however. Older versions of VisualBoyAdvance will require the GBA BIOS file in order to run normally with this option.</li>
            <li><b>Save Config</b>: Saves your current configuration, including the ROM location. This configuration will be automatically loaded on next run.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Randomization</h3>
        <p>Randomizable components. Note that, as of 0.10.0, you can add your own Neo Exdeath patches by placing them in the <tt>ned/</tt> directory.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Seed</b>: A number used to set the random number generator to a known state. The range accepted is 0 through 2<sup>31</sup> &ndash; 1, inclusive. Default value is the current time in seconds since 1 January 1970 00:00 UTC, divided by 3600.</li>
            <li><b>Neo ExDeath</b>: Pick graphics for the final boss.</li>
            <li><b>Abilities</b>: Shuffles abilities such that all Jobs learn five abilities and have a randomized command.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Innate abilities</h3>
        <p>Each checkbox applies the listed innate ability to all Jobs.</p>
        <h3>Multipliers</h3>
        <p>Multiply experience, ability point, or gil awards from battle. Experience and gil are hard-capped at 65,535 and ability points are hard-capped at 255, regardless of multiplier.</p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>The 'Unlocked Jobs' patch includes a patch that allows <b>!Combine</b> ammo to drop prior to unlocking the sealed weapons. This alters the drop tables for the following enemies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buckshot:<ul>
                <li>Black Flame</li>
                <li>Birostris</li>
                <li>Elm Gigas</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Blastshot:<ul>
                <li>Blood Slime</li>
                <li>Executor</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Blitzshot:<ul>
                <li>Mummy</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to create your own Neo Exdeath graphics</h3>
        <p>You will need two things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An image editor that supports PNG. I suggest Krita, Aseprite, or similar.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/VulpineAmethyst/png2ned">png2ned</a>; read the instructions there.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><tt>png2ned</tt> does the hard work, but once the graphics are inserted in to the ROM, you will need to use a program like <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/">LunarIPS</a> or <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/patch/">RHDN's online patcher</a> to create a patch by providing the unmodified ROM and the patched ROM.</p>
